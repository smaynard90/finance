# About
This project was my submission for [CS50's "Finance" problem set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/9/finance/). 
The project was originally written in SQLite within the CS50 IDE for local deployment. In order to demo it, I migrated the database to PostgreSQL so I could deploy it on Heroku.
